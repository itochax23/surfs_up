# Surfs Up 

## Overview

This assignment was to use Python, SQLAlchemy and Flask to analyze and visualize climate data as we help someone prepare to open a surf shop. To take it further, we explore temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Analysis
By running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December we can learn more about temperatures year-round. We can then store the temperature information in a list before converting them to a dataframe. As a dataframe we can get summary statistics for the data by using the .describe() method. 

### June
Summary statistics:
* three
* major

### December
Summary statistics:
* points

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
